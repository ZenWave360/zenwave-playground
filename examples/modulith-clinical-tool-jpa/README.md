## Getting Started


After cloning the project, you can start the project with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```

### Prerequisites


* Java 21+
* Maven 3.6+
* Docker/Docker Compose
* Git and Git-Bash
* JBang and ZenWave SDK (optional)
* SDKMAN! (optional but highly recommended)


## Technologies

* Spring Boot 3.3.x
* Spring Data JPA or MongoDB
* Spring Data Elasticsearch
* Spring Cloud Streams for Kafka, RabbitMQ, or other Message Brokers
* Spring Security
* KarateDSL for API Testing
* ZenWave SDK for Domain Modeling and Code Generation (optional)


### Authentication and Authorization

The configuration files are `SecurityConfiguration`, `OneTimeTokenConfiguration`, `UserManagementConfig`.

#### Login

The project comes configured with **LoginForm Authentication** except for SwaggerUI which is configured for Basic Authentication for convenience.

However, it has been configured for authentication exception handling with an entry point that sends a **"401 UNAUTHORIZED"** status code. This is convenient for REST API clients but has the consequence that SpringSecurity will not generate the HTML login form when a request requiring authentication is made and the user is not authenticated.

To address this inconvenience, the project includes a `src/main/resources/public/apis/login-openapi.yml` file with the necessary requests for both sending a LoginForm Authentication request and requesting and using a One-Time Authentication Token.

Default user is `admin/password`.


## API First

### OpenAPI / SwaggerUI


The project uses `openapi-generator-maven-plugin` (see pom.xml) to generate SpringMVC interfaces and DTOs from the `src/main/resources/public/apis/openapi.yml` file.

Generated sources are placed in `target/generated-sources/openapi` which becomes a source folder for the project. To implement the API, you can create a new `@RestController` and implement the generated interface.


#### Customization


You can customize generated code with this properties in `pom.xml` or directly in the plugin `openapi-generator-maven-plugin`: 
```xml
<openApiApiPackage>${basePackage}.adapters.web</openApiApiPackage>
<openApiModelPackage>${basePackage}.adapters.web.model</openApiModelPackage>
```

SwaggerUI is available at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html. If you need to add more OpenAPI files, you can customize SwaggerUI in `application.yml`:

```yaml
springdoc.swagger-ui.urls:
   - name: Project Name
     url: /apis/openapi.yml
```

URL is relative to `src/main/resources/public`.


## Code Formating


This project is configured to use [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) with Palantir Java Format as code formatter. You can apply code formatting from the command line with the following command:

```bash
mvn spotless:apply
```

```bash
echo "hey"
```

You can also configure your IDE for code automatic code formating with the following plugins:

- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13180-palantir-java-format
- https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format/tree/develop/eclipse_plugin

Keep a consistent code style from the beginning of the project.


### Palantir IntelliJ plugin


The plugin will be disabled by default on new projects. To manually enable it in the current project, go to `Fileâ†’Settings...â†’palantir-java-format Settings` (or `IntelliJ IDEAâ†’Preferences...â†’Other Settingsâ†’palantir-java-format Settings` on macOS) and check the Enable palantir-java-format checkbox.

To enable it by default in new projects, use `Fileâ†’Other Settingsâ†’Default Settings...`.

When enabled, it will replace the normal Reformat Code action, which can be triggered from the Code menu or with the Ctrl-Alt-L (by default) keyboard shortcut.
